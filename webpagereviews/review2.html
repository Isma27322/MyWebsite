        <h1>Website review for <a href="https://csszengarden.com/">csszengarden.com</a></h1>

        <h2>The purpose of csszengarden</h2>
        <p>The purpose of csszengarden is to show what css code can do!
        <br>It can show the different things people have made from just one html file but different css files.
        <br>It also proves that you can do a lot of things with just css code.</p>

        <h2>Validation</h2>  <!--Showing if the different parts of the websites passed-->

        <h4>Home page</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>The home page did not pass the validation</li>

        <h4>Secondary page: Steel</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>The secondary page did not pass the validation</li>
            <li>Warnings: 4</li>
            <li>Errors: 0</li>
            <li>info statements: 0</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Site design</h2>
        <h4>Main page: </h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Rateing: 8.5 out of 10</li> <!--Rateing for the main page-->
            <li>I gave the main page a rateing of 8.5 out of 10 because the webpage is really good.
            <br>The webpage is a little cluttered and might not make sence to people that don't really know what css and html code is.
            <br>The webpage is really cool though because it shows what people have made with just a different css file.
            <br>It shows the power of just a css file.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Secondary page: Steel</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Rateing: 9.6 out of 10</li> <!--Rateing for the secondary page-->
            <li>I gave the secondary page a rateing of 9.6 out of 10 because it is really cool.
            <br>It has interactive text boxes that drop down when you hover over them.
            <br>The website has a really good style that is really cool.
            <br>The website is really good.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <br>

        <h2>Meet purpose</h2>
        <p>I would definitely say that the website still meets the perpiouse for what it is supposed to do.
        <br>Even though the webpages don't pass the validations, if it sill does what it needs it is fine.
        <br>The webpage itself is really cool. And shows the power that you can just do with just a css file.</p>
