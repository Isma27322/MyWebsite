        <h2>Validation</h2>  <!--Showing if the different parts of the websites passed-->

        <h4>Home page (Place order page)</h4> <!--Main page-->
        <ul>
            <li>The home page did not pass the validation</li>
            <li>Warnings: 13</li>

        <h2>Site design</h2> <!--The rateing I give to the main and seconday page of the webstie.-->
        <h4>Main page: (Place order page)</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Rateing: 9.6 out of 10</li> <!--Rateing for the main page-->
            <li>I gave the main page a rateing of 9.6 out of 10 because it is a really good website and it does what it needs.
            <br>but one thing that I think when I use this part of the webstie is that it can be a little busy and a little hard to understand sometimes. 
            <br>but it is really good.
            </li>
        </ul>





        <h4>Secondary page: (Select payment type)</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Rateing: 9.6 out of 10</li> <!--Rateing for the secondary page-->
            <li>I gave the secondary page a reateing of 9.6 out of 10 because it is a really good website and it does what it needs.
            <br>It can sometimes be a litle overwelming when you have a credit card added with point rewards,
            <br>it can be hard to see if you are using them or not on amazon. But it isin't a crazy big deal.
            <br>But other than that it is really good.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <br>





        <h2>Meet purpose</h2>
        <p>Amazon is a really good websteite and is used a lot everyday.
        <br>As long as it works and does what the user expects it is fine.
        <br>I would say that the two pages do exactly what they need to so and it is fine.
        <br>Page(s) don't need to pass the validation to be a good webpage.
        </p>
