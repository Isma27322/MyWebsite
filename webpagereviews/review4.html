        <h1>User Testing for Websites</h1>

        <h2>What is User Testing?</h2>
        <p>User testing is the process of ensuring that your website functions and looks as intended across different
            browsers and devices. It helps you identify potential usability issues before your website goes live.</p>
        <p>By conducting user testing, you can ensure your website offers a smooth and positive experience for all
            visitors, regardless of their device or browser.</p>

        <h2>Why is User Testing Important?</h2>
        <p>User testing offers several key benefits, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Identifying usability issues: User testing can help you uncover problems users might face while
                navigating or interacting with your website.</li>
            <li>Improving user experience: By addressing usability issues, you can create a more intuitive and
                user-friendly website, leading to higher user satisfaction.</li>

                convert visitors into paying customers or leads.</li>

            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What Happens During User Testing?</h2>

            observe and record their actions and feedback.</p>
