        <h1>Website review for W3Schools.com</h1>
        <br>
        <h2>The purpose of W3Schools</h2>

        <h2>Site design</h2> <!--Showing the rateings of the different parts of the websites-->

        <h4>Main page: </h4> 
        <ul>
            <li>Rateing: 8 out of 10</li> <!--Rateing for the main page-->
            <li>I gave the main page a rateing of 8 out of 10 because it is really good but it can be a little confusing sometimes
            <br>I feel it is inconsistant with the button sizes on the bottom, the stuff listed after eachother dosen't really match very well 
            <br>Overall I think that the main website is really good but it does need some imporovement</li>
        </ul>
        <br>

        <h4>Secondary page: python</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Rateing: 8 out of 10</li> <!--Rateing for the secondary page-->
            <li>I gave it a rateing of 8 out of 10 because I would say that it does do what it needs but it does seem a little cludered On the left hand side of the webstie
            <br> There are some parts that are really good and imformitive that can really help you when you need it.
            <br> The website has some interactive lessons that are there to help you learn.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>


        <h2>Meet purpose</h2>
        <p>I would say that the website still meets the perpiouse for what it is supposed to do.</p>
        <p>Even though the validation didin't pass dosen't meen that the website dosen't do what it needs</p>
        <br>
