        <h1>Website review for <a href="https://www.webfx.com/blog/web-design/progressive-enhancement">webfx.com progressive enhancement</a></h1>

        <h2>The purpose of webfx.com progressive enhancement</h2>
        <p>The purpose of webfx.com progressive enhancement website is to explain what progressive enhancement is and
        <br>why it is so important to programers who program html css and JavaScript code.</p>



        <h2>What are progressive enhancements?</h2>
        <p>Progressive enhancemen is where you seperate the html, css, and JavaScript code.
        <br>It is so that the code can be reused through mutible files.</p>



        <h2>Why do you need progressive enhancements?</h2>
        <p>You need progressive enhancements because it maes makeing websites so much more efficient.
        <br>It allows you to seperate the html, css, and JavaScript code into three seperate files that will be able to be used in more than one html website.
        <br>If you use progressive enhancement you are just able to import the css and JavaScript files into the html file that you want to use it in.
        <br>You are only required to write one css and JavaScript file for mutible html files.
        <br>Where if you don't use progressive enhancement you be writeing the css and js code inside the html file.
        <br>You will be writeing the same code mutible times if you want the same look and functionality. 
        <br>There will be a lot of repeat code.
        </p>

        <h2>Site design</h2> <!--The rateing I give to the main and seconday page of the webstie.-->
        <h4>Main page: </h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Rateing: 9 out of 10</li> <!--Rateing for the main page-->
            <li>I gave the main page a rateing of 9 out of 10 because the website is really good, but it still needs some important.
            <br>I do still think that the website needs some imporvement.
            <br>I personaly feel that they should have only talked about just progressive enhancement.
            <br>I noticed that they talked about stuff that is not related to progressive enhancement.
            <br>And it just makes some people who read it confused because they should have just linked to the other pages.
            <br>But other than that the website is really good.
            </li>
        </ul>





        <h4>Secondary page: 10 ways to improve your web page performance</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Rateing: 9 out of 10</li> <!--Rateing for the secondary page-->
            <li>I gave the secondary page a reateing of 9 out of 10 because it is really good, but it still need imporvement
            <br>I feel that there should be some more recomdations that make more sence to most programers.
            <br>I personaly feel that some of the things that they recomend is really good but it might not make sence to people that are just starting to program.
            <br>But other than that the website is really good.
            </li>

        <h2>Meet purpose</h2>
        <p>The website deffently meets the purpose that it needs.
        <br>Even if the website didin't pass the validation it still does what it needs.
        <br>The website is really good. And it shows that it is a really good idea to do seperate html, css and JavaScript files.
